   Run the Java Program :
                          1) Using command prompt

                          2) Using IDE (eclipse)

   Compiler :
                 
              Source file (Code in English like language) ------ Program (.java)

                                  Compiler ( javac )
              
              Byte code (binary form)

                                  JVM (Java Virtual Machine)  -----> (java) ---> Interpreter
              
              Run application

   Setting the JAVA Path :

                         1) Temporary way
					   Command prompt >  SET PATH = pathname

                         2) Permanent way
                                           Through Control Panel

   Java Path : 
               Path where java is installed

 1)  Compiling Java Program

                              javac ------> To compile java program 

                              Syntax:
                                        > javac filename.java 

                                        > javac demo.java


          Note : After compilation java byte code is generated by compiler (.class file)


 2)  Running / executing Java Program


                               java -----> To run/ execute java program
                  
                               Syntax:
                                        > java filename
                                       
                                        > java demo


  Java Language :
                 1) Platform independent language
                 2) High Level language
                 3) Secure 
                 4) Object oriented language
                 5) Case sensitive ( age & Age both are different)
                 6) Compiled & interpreted language (Write once & run anywhere)
                 7) Strongly Typed Language


  Byte code :
              compiled code from the source file (.class)

              JVM reads the byte code

              Platform independent

  JVM : 
              Platform Dependent

                     4) Mobile Applications


  
   Programming Structure of Java Program :

   
                         class classname
			 {
                                
                                  function defintions


                                  main function definition      
                                            Create objects  
                         }


            
    Note : main() method is automatically called by JVM.

    Classes :  
              Grouping of data members 
              
	      Data members : varibales & methods

              Performs a specific task

              Class is a blueprint which is used to create an object.

              class defines the behaviour(methods) and it has some states(variables)

              Member variable : is the variable declared inside a class.

              Member method   : is the method defined inside a class.
      
              Every class will have a name.

              class is a keyword in java

    We can use the following classes:

              1) Predefined classes : System, String

              2) User defined classes  : demo, demo1,pro1, Addition


    Object :

		Real world entity which has the attributes / features.

               Ex :
                       Product : Class

                       Type of products
                     
                         (objects) Laptop : features --- color, price, storage, processor

   			           printer : features ---- cost, printerBrand, capacity
                
		Every object will be different from every other object     
         


     How to define a class :


                             class classname
			     {
				  Classmembers (member variables, member methods)

			     }


			Ex : 
                              class Student
			      {

					int rollno;      // member variable

					void showRoll()  // member method
					{
						
					}
			      }

                              class demo
			      {
					public tatic void main(String args[])
					{
						Student s1 = new Student();    // s1 is object of student class
						s1.showRoll();
					}
   			      }

     Object Creation :
                            
                     classname objectname = new classname();


     Pillers of Java :

			1) Encapsulation : Enclosure / Unit 
					   Unit of data members
					   Ex : Class 
                                           
                            Data hiding : feature to hide the data of a class from outside the class or outside world.
 

			2) Abstraction  :
					To hide implementation details of the class


			3) Inheritance  :
                                         To access the features of one class into another class.

					 Object :     class (Parent class of all classes of the program)

			4) Polymorphism :
                                         Many forms
